<h2>Description</h3>
<p>
     Currently the project is still in the prototyping phase, so nothing is final yet. 
</p>
<p>
    The game is a first person shooter where you fight various NPC in an enclosed environment.
</p>

<strong>​The game so far</strong>
<p>
    ​​There are currently 2 levels. 
    The first level is in a small arena where you must fight to survive against a relentless torrent of enemies. 
    This level is very simplistic and will probably not be improved in its current form. 
</p>
<p>
    The second level is set in a slime infested warehouse with many shelves and boxes. 
    The objective is to wipe out the slimes before they destroy too much of the warehouse. 
    These slimes will hunt down the player, collect slime balls to grow stronger or attack the shelves and boxes if they can not find the player. 
    Slimes will spawn new slimes when they are strong enough. 
    There are also spiked balls throughout the warehouse that, once active, will charge at the player - damaging anything in their path. 
    Once all the slimes are defeated the level is over.
</p>
