Creating this level took longer than i expected because of a few factors. I was trying out creating the level using scripts in the editor. It turned out that it would have probably been better to have created big parts of the level in a 3d modelling program like [blender](https://www.blender.org/). But now the scripts have are working well creating future levels should be quicker and be easier to add textures to the level in the future.

Another thing that took longer than i excepted was the lighting. Trying to set up the lighting in a way that looked ok while not being too big took a while as baking the light map after changes takes a long time.

The plans for future updates is to expand on this level to add more rooms and a second floor. I also plan to add new entities that will interact with objects in the level.

### Changes

* Added Spaceship One level
    * The level is made up of a few rooms with Enemies in each
    * The objective is to defeat the slimes before they cause too much damage to the ship
    * This level has dynamic lighting instead of the basic lighting used in the other levels.
* Made a few modifications to the AI
    * the aim was to make the AI seem more smooth.
