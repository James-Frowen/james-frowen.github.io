# version v0-0-3 

Trying to increase threat to player by increasing the movement speed of the slimes. Attack anmimation for slimes have also been added so that it is more clear when they are attacking.

### Changes

* Increased Slime movement speed
    * Base speed is now faster
    * Speed now scales with health (size), smaller slimes move faster.
* Adding Slime attack animation.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug where parts of the game start in paused state when levels after the first time.
