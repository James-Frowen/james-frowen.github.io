I am changing the way I am doing version for Quantum robot. The old system I was releasing stable builds slightly more than once a week. I am not very happy that I am delaying small changes that seem important in order to have more to write in a change log.

The new system I am planning to use mean I will push a new "indev" version regularly. This build will likely be less stable and contain bugs. I will still be planning to releases the stable version weekly with a change log.

With this change i will be moving the game version to v0-1-x to act as a kind of reset for the version numbers and to make it easier to distinguish between the old and new system.
