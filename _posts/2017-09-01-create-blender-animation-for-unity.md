# Create blender animation for unity with shape keys

Create shape keys
change to animation view
change from dope sheet to shape key editor
set keyframes for animation
click `F` next to action name so the data is always saved 
(how to delete actions?)
change from shape key editor to action editor
set keyframe (location?) for first and last frame
export .fbx
import into unity
in inspector import settings under animations
add clips for each action
create animation controller




if you want mulitple actions add them on same timeline after each other
eg
idle 0->120
attack 130->150
