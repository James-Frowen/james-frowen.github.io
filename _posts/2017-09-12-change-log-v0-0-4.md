### Changes

* New Enemy: Spiker
    * Fast, high damage, but low health
    * Start inactive until the player comes near them
    * Rolls quickly towards the player and damages anything in their path
    * Damage decreases slightly each time it hits something
    * The damage dealt is a percent of max health of the entity they hit
* Slimes now rotate to face their target before attacking
* Minor changes to AI navigation
