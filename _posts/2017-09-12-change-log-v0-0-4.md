### Changes

* Adding new Enemy, Spiker
    * Spikers are fast, have high damage, but have low health
    * Spikers start inactive until the player comes near them
    * Spikers will charge at the player and damage anything in their path
    * A spikers damage decrease slightly each time it deals damage
    * The damage spikers deal a percent of max health of the entity they hit
* Slimes now rotate to face their target before attacking
