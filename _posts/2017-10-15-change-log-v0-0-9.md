The updated weapon system only allows the player to hold 2 weapons at a team and requires them to collect more ammo as the level progresses.

When the level is lost instead of going back to the main menu there is an option to restart the level. Additionally the reason for winning or losing is shown. Adding an objective to the spaceship level to stop the slimes from destroying more than 100 crates, this combined with random spawn location for player and slimes means that the player can not just hide in a safe location and slowly destroy the slimes one by one.

The slime AI calculates its next action less frequently but it will recalculate if it completes its action early. Spiker that roll over slime blobs will pick them up and drop them all when they are destroyed. 

### Changes

    * Shows when the current mission is failed

    * Only 2 weapons can be held at a time
    * Weapons held are show in the top left of the player's HUD

* The force a grenade is thrown increases as you hold down the fire button

### Bug Fixes

* Small slimes continue to damage player when on top of them
