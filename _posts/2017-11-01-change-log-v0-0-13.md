Adding loading screens when levels are first loaded. Loading screens were not added when restarting a level since it is much quicker than when it is first loaded.

Increasing the duration the player can run before having to recharge, this is to make running a bit more useful.

### Changes

* Adding loading screen when starting new level
* Increase duration player can run
* Adding bullet decals
    * slimes when shot have particle effects instead of decals


### Bug Fixes

* No more delay between when player dies and when the lose screen is shown
